# My Django Project

I've taken classes on Django for Everybody (DJ4E) courses and made some web apps with django.
You can see these apps and more [here](http://frutose.pythonanywhere.com/).
*(The **autos** app is essentialy the same as the **cats** app)*

I'll eventually let the user create an account to mess with some of the features, but right now you can login as

user: **user** / password: **django12**

### The apps

* #### Home
It has some base bootstrap html that I've used on DJ4E courses.

* #### Polls
That was my very first app, following the tutorial on [django project documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/).
It has only two models: *Question* and *Answer*.

* #### Cats
That was one of my first CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications. It has some features like adding, deleting and update a *Breed* or a *Cat*.

* #### Ads
Ads is a CRUD application that has "owned" features.
You can see all other *Ads* already made, but you can only update or delete those whose owner are you.


All the html were built using Django Template Language (DTL).
